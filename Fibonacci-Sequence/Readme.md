###Fibonacci Sequence
Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

>By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
